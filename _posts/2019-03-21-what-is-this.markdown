On the 30th of March, I posted two stories on Instagram in which one of them had to do with my name. Based on the poll results, I changed my name, but I'm not doing this to offend anyone.

Here are those Instagram stories -

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img class="post-image" src="img/1/1.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img class="post-image" src="img/1/2.png" alt="">
  </div>
</div>

__PS :__ The selfie was taken 3 years back when I was in New Delhi.

#### Funny Story

At first, I wanted __[this](bomb/)__ (hehe) to be the first and the only page of the blog, and then I decided to build __[this](quote/)__ and replaced it with the previous one.

<small><strong>Do checkout both pages!</strong></small>

The reason behind the removal was that because I didn't want anyone to feel offended due to the content. Is it a pussy move? I don't know, but one thing we can ask here - Who is the real pussy? Me or the one who takes offence?

When you'll check the first page, you'll understand what I'm talking about.

__Why did I buy the domain?__

To be honest, I don't know, but it looks funny and I can use it for some purpose.

__What I'm planning to do?__

My presence on social media is like a bubble, and I don't want people to forget me. I built this place so that those who care (and those who don't) can check what's up with me.

The good part - I won't talk about myself. You'll see nice and decent things on the blog. For example, I've already written another post which is filled with the content that I'll be putting here.

__Every Sunday, you'll get to see a new blog post.__ Hopefully, you'll like them.

#### Alhamdullilah

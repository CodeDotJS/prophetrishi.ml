__Updates__

It's mostly a farewell. I had a great time putting contents here, but due to the shortage of time, I won't be able to continue doing the same.

If you are reading this, you probably visit this place once in a while, and I hope you love it, too! It would be sad to see you go away, but hey, I've put great music and links which can help you kill some minutes of your life. I think it would be okay if you come here, just in case you get bored someday.

Life is getting busy. There are lots of things I've got to do, and maintaining this place can be a bit hard because I've to give some time to decide what to put. I can't, and I don't want to post useless things here.

Although this place was getting much more traffic than I expected, but it's not about the numbers. I really wish I could continue.

To be honest, I'm not sure when I'll be back, but you can subscribe to the mailing list, in case you would like to receive the posts if someday I push updates to the blog.

Keep smiling. You are the best!

__Thank You!__
